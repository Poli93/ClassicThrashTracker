# Classic Thrash Tracker

Displays Thrash stacks on creatures nameplates and a text message once the ability is used.
Findings from my testings suggest that:

* Thrash can only stack up to 2.
* Stores procs until instance/server reset
* Has a cooldown of 4 seconds.

* Some monsters have a “Thrash” mechanic and can proc multiple attacks against players in a very short duration.
Note: Most of these monsters can also “store” these procs and unleash them all several seconds later.
An example of this is the Princess Theradras encounter in Maraudon.
The Princess will store her attacks if kited and can land several attacks instantly when she catches up to her target. This behavior is consistent with the reference client
